This approach allows the model to output free-form descriptions of protein function, capturing more nuanced biological detail than methods limited to discrete categories alone. Still, there are persistent issues, such as handling ambiguous data, achieving high verifiability of predictions, and dealing with potentially novel but currently unverified protein functions.\n","\n","\n","###Proposed Solution:\n","\n","\n","Enhancement of Fine-Tuning Strategy: We aim to improve the model‚Äôs correctness for lesser-known proteins by exploring alternative instruction-tuning prompts or additional curated examples from the same Swiss-Prot data source referenced in the paper.\n","\n","\n","Performance Benchmarks: As described in the paper, we will evaluate free-form text outputs (against curated Swiss-Prot annotations) and discrete function categories (like catalytic type, ligand binding) to measure accuracy and F1 scores.\n","Core Novelty:\n","We will focus on improving precision for partially correct outputs, possibly by integrating a confidence scoring mechanism that flags uncertain answers for further user probing.\n","Technologies to Be Used:\n","\n","\n","Protein Encoder: xTrimoPGLM (as in the paper).\n","Large Language Model: Vicuna-based model (as in the paper).\n","Data: Swiss-Prot dataset for curated protein-function annotations, with additional filtering steps to strengthen data quality.\n","Implementation Stack: Python and PyTorch for training; minimal changes to the paper‚Äôs methodology to maintain comparability.\n","\n","\n","###Expected Output / Deliverables:\n","\n","\n","Extended Multi-Modal LLM: A refined system capable of protein-function predictions in both free-form text and discrete categories, building directly on the paper‚Äôs model.\n","Accuracy and F1 Comparisons: Tables and charts showing performance on Swiss-Prot test proteins, focusing on where improvements occur.\n","\n","\n","###Challenges / Open Questions:\n","\n","\n","Handling Novel Proteins: The paper notes that purely sequence-based predictions may be limited if there is minimal existing data. We must still address how to refine or confirm predictions for rarely characterized proteins.\n","Balancing Free-Form Output and Accuracy: Free-form text is expressive, but may include inaccuracies. The best way to filter or highlight uncertain segments remains an open issue.\n","Computational Cost: Training and fine-tuning large models can be resource-intensive; careful planning of training schedules is critical to manage runtime.\n","\n","\n","###References:\n","Huo, M., Guo, H., Cheng, X., Singh, D., Rahmani, H., Li, S., Gerlof, P., Ideker, T., Grotjahn, D.A., Villa, E., Song, L., & Xie, P.
